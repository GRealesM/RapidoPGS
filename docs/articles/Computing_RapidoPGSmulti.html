</h2>
<p>RápidoPGS is a tool to quickly compute polygenic scores (PGS) from GWAS summary statistics datasets from either case-control (eg. asthma) or quantitative traits (eg. height and BMI).</p>
<p>Input GWAS summary statistics datasets should have a minimum set of columns, with these names, but in any order:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>CHR</strong>: Chromosome</li>
<li>
<strong>BP</strong>: Base position (in GRCh37/hg19 or GRCh38/hg38). If using hg38, use build = “hg38” in parameters.</li>
<li>
<strong>SNPID</strong>: rsids, or SNP identifiers. If not available, they can be anything (eg. CHR_BP).</li>
<li>
<strong>REF</strong>: Reference, or non-effect allele</li>
<li>
<strong>ALT</strong>: Alternative, or effect allele, the one  refers to</li>
<li>
<strong>BETA</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> (or log(OR)), or effect sizes.</li>
<li>
<strong>SE</strong>: Standard error of <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>P</strong>: P-values for the association test</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, if doing a PGS on a quantitative trait GWAS dataset, your file must include this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>ALT_FREQ</strong>: Minor/ALT allele frequency in the tested population, or in a close population from a reference panel.</li>
</ul>

</h2>
<p>RápidoPGS-multi is slightly less simple to run than RápidoPGS-single, as it requires LD matrices to inform on the relationships between SNPs in the data. To that end we have two options: <strong>(1) Use a reference panel</strong>, and <strong>(2) Use pre-computed LD matrices</strong>. In this section we will deal with the first option.</p>
<p>A reference panel is simply genomic data obtained from a representative sample of a larger population. For example, the UK Biobank cohort comprises ~500,000 individuals between 40 and 69 years old from the United Kingdom and can be used as a reference for the UK (or more roughly, European) population. Unfortunately, UK Biobank data is only available to researches upon application, so in this example we will use the fully public 1000 Genomes Project Phase III as a reference panel.</p>
<p>The 1000 Genomes Project Phase III comprises genomic data from 2504 individuals from multiple world populations, and although its sample size is relatively small compared to UK Biobank, it has the nice feature of being open for everyone to use it.</p>
<p>Prior to running RápidoPGS-multi, we need to set up our reference panel. To easen things, you can use the <code>create_1000G</code>, which will do everything for you. Bear in mind that this will take ~60GB of disk memory and a while, depending of your internet connection, so be warned! You can tweak the QC parameters as you see fit. See function documentation for more information.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<h2 id="preparing-ld-matrices-uk-biobank-case">Preparing LD matrices (UK Biobank case)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#preparing-ld-matrices-uk-biobank-case"></a>
</h2>
<p>Alternatively, we can use pre-computed LD matrices (from a larger panel, for example). In our paper, we use pre-computed LD matrices from the UK Biobank panel, made publicly available by LDpred2 authors <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/European_LD_reference/13034123" class="external-link">here</a>.</p>
<p>These matrices comprise ~1 million HapMap3 variants, and were computed on 362,320 UK Biobank individuals. We can download and set them up using the following code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/files2.html" class="external-link">dir.create</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"ukbb"</span><span class="op">)</span>  <span class="co"># Or whatever you like</span></span>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you get some error or warning when unzipping from the R session (eg. “Zip file is corrupt” warning), try to unzip normally, using either a terminal or right-clicking on the file and extracting it.</p>
<p>With this, your LD matrix directory should be ready. We prepared <code><a href="../reference/rapidopgs_multi.html">rapidopgs_multi()</a></code> function to work out of the box with these LD matrices, which are (1) Separated by chromosomes, (2) class “dsCMatrix”, (3) contained in <code>.rds</code> files, and (4) accompanied by a manifest, <code>map.rds</code>, containing information on the variants in the LD matrices (HapMap3 variants in this case).</p>
<p>Note that these matrices are computed using a European population, so they won’t be the best fit for generating a PGS for a non-European population. If that is your case, you can use the reference panel option, as it contains many populations from most ancestries.</p>
<p>At the moment, this is the only format RápidoPGS supports for pre-computed LD matrices, and we cannot foresee all possible formats, so if you want to use your own matrices with RápidoPGS-multi, please ensure to provide them in the described format.</p>
<p><strong>A brief note on ancestries</strong>: By default, RápidoPGS expects European ancestry data, which is the most common in the GWAS field – and an issue to be tackled. However, as a beta, untested option, RápidoPGS can now accommodate other ancestries. To do so, you’ll need to provide either LD matrices or a reference panel from the non-European population, via the <code>LDmatrices</code> or <code>reference</code> arguments, respectively. You’ll also need to provide an LD block file via the <code>LDblocks</code> argument. This file should be analog to our EUR_ld.blocks files in <code>data/</code> and be in the same format. At the moment we haven’t tested RápidoPGS on different ancestries, but feel free to try and let us know if you find issues doing so.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/" class="external-link">GWAS catalog</a> is an outstanding GWAS summary statistics data source, as it not only puts together tons of public datasets, but it also uses a semi-automatic pipeline to apply quality control and liftover (a.k.a. harmonise) those datasets, thus helping overcome the problem of having GWAS sumstats in so many different formats and builds.</p>
<p>In this vignette, we’ll use GWAS catalog to obtain an example dataset. For this vignette we’ll use a Breast cancer (BRCA) dataset from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24284" class="external-link">Michailidou et al., 2017</a>, which is one that we used in our manuscript. This GWAS was performed on 119078 controls and 137045 cases of Breast cancer.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: Input GWAS summary statistics and your reference panel (or LD matrices) <strong>must be in the same build</strong>. Both 1000 Genomes and UK Biobank LD matrices are in GRCh37/hg19 build, while harmonised GWAS catalog files come in GRCh38/hg38.</p>
<p>You can use <code><a href="../reference/gwascat.download.html">gwascat.download()</a></code> to download files from GWAS catalog see the RápidoPGS single <a href="https://grealesm.github.io/RapidoPGS/articles/Computing_RapidoPGSsingle.html" class="external-link">vignette</a>. In this case, we downloaded the hg19 version of the file <a href="http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gwas/summary_statistics/GCST004001-GCST005000/GCST004988/harmonised/29059683-GCST004988-EFO_0000305-build37.f.tsv.gz" class="external-link">here</a>, sampled 100,000 random SNPs (for educational purposes only, you don’t need to sample SNPs when building your PGS), and saved it as <code>michailidou19</code>, which we’ll now load.</p>
